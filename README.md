## My Personal Website

My personal website built using React, Typescript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and styled-components. The website boasts a modern design with an interactive feel and dynamic features! The website is a formal introduction of myself, and it showcases my past and current work experience, educational history, and technical skills!

In order to run this locally on your machine, you can simply clone the repo using either HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI, you can find the instructrions for cloning a repo at https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository. Once you have the repo cloned you just need to go ahead and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

After running this you can just run:

```
npm run dev
```

The server will start and provide your the local host url. It will also provide you a network url which you can use to view the website on any device connected to the same network that your machine is on.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the website! Let me know if you have anything in mind or would like to suggest some changes! Also you can connect with me on LinkedIn here https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishfaq-malik-46bb7a201/.
